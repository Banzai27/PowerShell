# Get-AdGroupMembershipChange

This script queries multiple Active Directory groups for new members in a domain. It records group membership in a CSV file in the same location as the script is located. 
On the script's initial run it will simply record all members of all groups into this CSV file. 
On subsequent runs it will query each group's member list and compare that list to what's in the CSV file.
If any differences are found (added or removed) the script will update the CSV file to reflect current memberships and notify an administrator of which members were either added or removed.

# Example

```
        PS> .\Get-AdGroupMembershipChange.ps1 -Email "florian.burnel@mydomain.fr" -LogFilePath "C:\Logs\Audit_Get-AdGroupMembershipChange\Audit_log.csv" -GroupFilePath "C:\Logs\Audit_Get-AdGroupMembershipChange\Audit_list_reference.csv" -Group "Administrateurs de lâ€™entreprise", "Admins du domaine"
